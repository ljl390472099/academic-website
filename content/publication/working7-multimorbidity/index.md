abstract: "**Background**


To identify the latent groups of multimorbidity trajectories among middle-aged and older adults and examine their associations with healthcare utilization and health expenditures.


**Methods**


We included adults aged ≥45 years who participated in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2015 and were without multimorbidities (<2 chronic conditions) at baseline. Multimorbidity trajectories underlying 13 chronic conditions were identified using group-based multi-trajectory modeling based on the latent dimensions. Healthcare utilization included outpatient care, inpatient care, and unmet healthcare needs. Health expenditures included healthcare costs and catastrophic health expenditures (CHE). Random-effects logistic regression, random-effects negative binomial regression, and generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between multimorbidity trajectories, healthcare utilization, and health expenditures.


**Results**


Of the 5548 participants, 2407 developed multimorbidities during follow-up. Three trajectory groups were identified among those with new-onset multimorbidity according to the increasing dimensions of chronic diseases: “digestive-arthritic” (N = 1377, 57.21 %), “cardiometabolic/brain” (N = 834, 34.65 %), and “respiratory/digestive-arthritic” (N = 196, 8.14 %). All trajectory groups had a significantly increased risk of outpatient care, inpatient care, unmet healthcare needs, and higher healthcare costs than those without multimorbidities. Notably, participants in the “digestive-arthritic” trajectory group had a significantly increased risk of incurring CHE (OR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.03–2.81).


**Limitations**


Chronic conditions were assessed using self-reported measures.



**Conclusions**


The growing burden of multimorbidity, especially multimorbidities of digestive and arthritic diseases, was associated with a significantly increased risk of healthcare utilization and health expenditures. The findings may help in planning future healthcare and managing multimorbidity more effectively."
